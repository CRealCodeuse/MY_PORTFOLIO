# Welcome-to-my-soon-to-be-big-GitHub-

Hello there !

#Welcome to my big-to-be GitHub !

#I'm only new there and trying my best to understand how GitHub correctly.

I'm a Web Development Bachelor searching actively for an apprenticeship.

I have already coded my own Portfolio, the only thing is I didn't bought a domain name yet, but soon.

I freakin love Python, and I'm learning about Javascript for now, to incorporate in my projetcs, as I have some in mind. The thing is I have to start them, and I will put updates here to motivate myself and also you can see how it's going.

I will probably make some mistakes, but I try to always debog my code by myself.

Just be kind.

Xoxo !
